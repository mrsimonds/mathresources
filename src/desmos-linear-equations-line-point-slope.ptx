            <title>An opportunity to use point-slope to determine the equation of a line</title>
                <statement>
                  <p>
                    Use the equation <m>y-y_1=m(x-x_1)</m> to determine the equation of the line that passes through
                    the point <m>(-3,2)</m> with a slope of <m>-\frac{5}{2}</m>.  Express the equation in 
                    slope-intercept form (<m>y=mx+b</m>).  Use the Desmos graph to check your answer.
                   </p>
                 </statement>
                 <solution>
                  <p>
                    We have <m>x_1=-3</m>, <m>y_1=2</m>, and <m>m=-\frac{5}{2}</m>.  Plugging these values into the
                    point-slope equation gives us <m>y-2=-\frac{5}{2}(x-(-3))</m>.  Solving for <m>y</m> we see
                    that the slope-intercept equation of the line is <m>y=-\frac{5}{2}x-\frac{11}{2}</m>.
                  </p>

                <statement>
                  <p>
                    Explain why it would be somewhat inefficient to use point-slope to determine an equation
                    of the line that passes through the points <m>(0,3)</m> and <m>(-2,6)</m>.
                   </p>
                 </statement>
                 <solution>
                  <p>
                    Since we're given the <m>y</m>-intercept, <m>(0,3)</m>, once we calculate the slope to be 
                    <m>-\frac{3}{2}</m>, we can use slope-intercept to simply write down the equation
                    <m>y=-\frac{3}{2}x+3</m>.
