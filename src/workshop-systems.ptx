        <statement>
          <p>
            A linear equation in <m>x</m> and <m>y</m> is an equation that can be written in the form <m>ax+by=c</m> where <m>a</m>, <m>b</m>, and <m>c</m> are constants, and not both <m>a</m> and <m>b</m> are <m>0</m>.  When graphed, a linear equation produces a line consisting of all of the ordered pairs that satisfy the equation (make the two sides of the equation have equal value).
          </p>
          <p>
            A linear system of equations in two variables is a collection of two or more linear equations with those two variables.  Solving a system of linear equations in two variables entails determining what ordered pairs, if any, satisfy every equation in the system.  With the advent of graphing technology, one efficient way of determining the solution set to a system of linear equations is by graphing the line associated with every equation in the system and analyzing the result.
          </p>
          <p>
            Consider the following system of equations.  Please note that the large left brace is the symbol we use to indicate that the two equations form a system <mdash/> that we are looking for ordered pairs that satisfy both equations in the system.
            <me>
              \left\{
                \begin{aligned}
                3x-2y\amp=-8\\
                2x-y\amp=-6\\
                \end{aligned}
              \right.
              </me>
              If we were going to graph these two lines by hand, there would be value in manipulating the equations into slope-intercept from.  Let's go ahead and do that.

              When solving a system of two linear equations with two unknowns, there are three possible outcomes for the nature of the solution.  The most common outcome is that there is exactly one ordered pair that satisfies both equations.  This outcome is illustrated by the intersecting lines shown in <xref ref="workshop-systems-graphing-examples-2">Figure</xref>  Another possible outcome is that no ordered pair satisfies both equations.  This outcome is illustrated by the parallel lines shown in <xref ref="workshop-systems-graphing-examples-3">Figure</xref>.  The third possible outcome is that the two equations are equivalent <mdash/> that they are two manifestations of the equation for the same line.  In this case, every point on the line satisfies both equations in the system.  This outcome is illustrated by the single line shown in <xref ref="workshop-systems-graphing-examples-4">Figure</xref>.

              When there is at least one ordered pair that satisfies both equations in the system, the system is said to be consistent.  When there are no ordered pairs that satisfy both equations in the system, the system is said to be inconsistent.

              When there is exactly one or zero ordered pairs that satisfy both equations in the system, the equations in the system are said to be independent.  When there is more than one ordered pair that satisfies both equations in the system, the equations are said to be dependent.

           <p>
            The system is graphed <xref ref="workshop-systems-substitution-examples-1">Figure</xref>. The system is clearly consistent, but there is no way to visually determine the exact solution based upon the graph.  If we were working with graphing technology, the software could undoubtedly determine the exact solution, but dependent upon the decimal form of the coordinates of the points, we may only be able to recognize an approximation of the solution.
          </p>
          <p>
            Surely people were able to determine the solution to that system before the advent of graphing technology.  Indeed they were.  There actually are several processes for determining the solution to linear systems of two equations with two unknowns.  In this section we are going to explore one of those processes, the process of substitution.
          </p>
          <p>
            Referring again to 
            <me>
              \left\{
                \begin{aligned}
                  2x-5y\amp=7\\
                  2x+y\amp=3\\
                \end{aligned}
              \right.
            </me>
            we can see that we could easily isolate <m>y</m> the second equation.  Let's go ahead and do that.
            <md>
              <mrow>2x+y\amp=3</mrow>
              <mrow>2x+y\subtractright{2x}\amp=3\subtractright{2x}</mrow>
              <mrow>y\amp=-2x+3</mrow>
            </md>
            Since the solution to the system must satisfy both equations in the system, it's got to be the case that the <m>y</m>-coordinate is equal to <m>-2x+3</m>.  We can use that fact to reduce the number of variables in the first equation to one by substituting the expression <m>-2x+3</m> for <m>y</m>. We can then solve the resultant equation for <m>x</m>.  Let's go ahead and do that.
            <md>
              <mrow>2x-5\highlight{y}\amp=7</mrow>
              <mrow>2x-5(\highlight{-2x+3})\amp=7</mrow>
              <mrow>2x+10x-15\amp=7</mrow>
              <mrow>12x-15\amp=7</mrow>
              <mrow>12x-15\addright{15}\amp=7\addright{15}</mrow>
              <mrow>12x\amp=22</mrow>
              <mrow>\divideunder{12x}{12}\amp=\divideunder{22}{12}</mrow>
              <mrow>x\amp=\frac{11}{6}</mrow>
            </md>
            So the solution has an <m>x</m>-coordinate of <m>\frac{11}{6}</m>.  Let's substitute that value for <m>x</m> in the equation <m>y=-2x+3</m> and simplify to determine the <m>y</m>-coordinate of the solution.
            <md>
              <mrow>y\amp=-2\highlight{x}+3</mrow>
              <mrow>y\amp=-2(\highlight{\frac{11}{6}})+3</mrow>
              <mrow>y\amp=-\frac{11}{3}+\frac{9}{3}</mrow>
              <mrow>y\amp=-\frac{2}{3}</mrow>
            </md>
            So the solution to the system of equations is the ordered pair <m>(\frac{11}{6},-\frac{2}{3})</m>.  Let's verify.
            <me>
              \left\{
                \begin{aligned}
                  2(\highlight{\frac{11}{6}})-5(\highlightr{-\frac{2}{3}})\amp=7\,?\\
                  2(\highlight{\frac{11}{6}})+(\highlightr{-\frac{2}{3}})\amp=3\,?\\

            The usual process of using substitution to solve a system of two linear equations with two unknowns is outlined below.  This is the process used when exactly one ordered pair satisfies the system.  Some of the steps are different in other situations <mdash/> those situations will be discussed later.
            <ol label="1">
              <li>
                Isolate one of the variables in one of the equations.  If you can, choose a variable and equation that will not result in unnecessary fractions.
              </li>
              <li>
                Substitute the expression on the other side of the isolated variable for that variable in the other equation.
              </li>
              <li>
                You now have an equation with only one variable.  Go ahead and solve that equation for the remaining variable.
              </li>
              <li>
                Substitute the value you determined in step 3 into the equation you found in step 1 to determine the value of the variable you isolated in step 1.
              </li>
              <li>
                Check your solution in both equations, and assuming it is correct, state your solution.  If the solution is not correct, find your mistake and/or rework the problem from scratch.

              The solution to the stated system of equations is the ordered pair <m>(-3,2)</m>.

            <p>
              We now turn our attention to the manner in which we recognize that a linear system of two equations has no solutions or an "infinite number" of solutions, the latter case occurring when the two equations are equivalent.  The process begins as if we were trying to find the unique ordered pair that satisfies the system.  The signal that we are in an usual situation occurs in step 3 of that process.  Let's see how.
              <ol label="1">
              <li>
                Isolate one of the variables in one of the equations.  If you can, choose a variable and equation that will not result in unnecessary fractions.
              </li>
              <li>
                Substitute the expression on the other side of the isolated variable for that variable in the other equation.
              </li>
              <li>
                You now have an equation with only one variable.  Go ahead and try to solve that equation for the remaining variable.  The thing that indicates that something unusual is afoot is when the variable disappears.  If that occurs, and what is left behind is a false statement (called a contradiction) such as <m>2=5</m>, you can conclude that there are no ordered pairs that satisfy both equations in the system. If the variable disappears and you are left with an equation that is always true (called an identity) such as <m>7=7</m>, you can conclude that the two equations in the system are different representations of the same line, and as such every ordered pair that falls on that line is a solution to the system.
              </li>  
            </ol>
            The easiest way to check that either of these two solution types is correct is to manipulate both equations from the system into slope-intercept form.  If the two equations really share no common ordered pairs, the two corresponding lines will have the same slope but different <m>y</m>-intercepts.  If the two equations are equivalent, then the slope-intercept forms of their equations will be identical.
          </p>

            We've arrived at an identity, so we conclude that the two equations in the system are two representations of the same line, and that every ordered pair that falls on that line is a solution to the system of equations.  We can check by manipulating both equations into slope-intercept form and making sure that the two results are identical.

            Because the slope-intercept forms of the two equations are identical, we can safely conclude that the system does indeed have an "infinite number" of solutions, specifically every ordered pair on the line <m>y=\frac{1}{3}x-2</m>.
          </p><p>Example</p>
          <p>
            Use the method of substitution to determined all solutions to the following system of equations.            
            <me>
              \left\{
                \begin{aligned}
                  4x+10y\amp=24\\
                  y\amp=-\frac{2}{5}x+5\\
                \end{aligned}
              \right.
            </me>
            Because <m>y</m> is already isolated in the second equation, let's run with that and substitute <m>-\frac{2}{5}x+5</m> for <m>y</m> in the first equation.
            <md>
              <mrow>4x+10\highlight{y}\amp=24</mrow>
              <mrow>4x+10(\highlight{-\frac{2}{5}x+5})\amp=24</mrow>
              <mrow>4x-4x+50\amp=24</mrow>
              <mrow>50\amp=24</mrow>
            </md>
            We've arrived at the contradiction <m>50=24</m>; no matter what values we assign to <m>x</m> and <m>y</m>, we cannot force <m>50</m> and <m>24</m> to be equal.  As such, it must be the case that there are no ordered pairs that satisfy both equations in the system.  We can check by manipulating the first equation into slope-intercept form and seeing that the slope of the line is <m>-\frac{2}{5}</m> but that the <m>y</m>-intercept is not <m>(0,5)</m> (as it is for the second equation).
            <md>
              <mrow>4x+10y\amp=24</mrow>
              <mrow>4x+10y\subtractright{4x}\amp=24\subtractright{4x}</mrow>
              <mrow>10y\amp=-4x+24</mrow>
              <mrow>\multiplyleft{\frac{1}{10}}10y\amp=\multiplyleft{\frac{1}{10}}(-4x+24)</mrow>
              <mrow>y\amp=-\frac{2}{5}x+\frac{12}{5}</mrow>
            </md>
            So we can see that if we graphed the two lines in the system, they would be parallel lines (same slope, different <m>y</m>-intercepts), so we are correct in our conclusion that the solution sets for the two equations share no common ordered pairs.

                  The last equation is an identity, it is true regardless of the values of <m>x</m> and <m>y</m>.  This means that the two original equations are equivalent <mdash/> they represent the same line.  We can check this by isolating <m>y</m> in the equation <m>3x-4y=8</m>.

                  This last equation is clearly equivalent to <m>y=\frac{3}{4}x-2</m>, so we are correct in our assertion that both equations in the original system represent the same line.  We conclude that every point that lies on the line <m>y=\frac{3}{4}x-2</m> is a solution to the given system.

                  We can begin by substituting <m>-\frac{1}{3}y+3</m> for <m>x</m> in the equation <m>y=-3x+7</m>.  We then (attempt) to solve the resultant equation for <m>y</m>.

                  The last equation is a contradiction, there are no values we can assign to <m>x</m> and <m>y</m> that will make <m>0</m> and <m>-2</m> equal!  This is an indication that there are no solutions to the given system.  We can check this by isolating <m>y</m> in the equation <m>x=-\frac{1}{3}y+3</m>.

This confirms that there is no point that lies on both lines.  The given system has no solutions, it is inconsistent.

    <title>Fractions - Sometimes They Cannot be Avoided</title>

        <statement>
          <p>
            Sometimes there is no avoiding fractions when applying the method of substitution to a linear system of equations.  For eaxmple, consider the following system of equations.       
            <me>
              \left\{
                \begin{aligned}
                  -5x+3y\amp=4\\
                  6x-7y\amp=2\\
                \end{aligned}
              \right.
            </me>
            No matter which variable we isolate, the expression on the other side of the equation will contain fractions.  Fortunately, once we've made the substitution we can clear away the fractions before proceeding to the solution.  Since there are no "good" choices, let's go ahead and solve the first equation for <m>y</m>.

            We can substitute <m>\frac{5}{3}x+\frac{4}{3}</m> for <m>y</m> in the second original equation and solve the resultant equation for <m>x</m>.

            Good grief.  Let's start by clearing away the fractions, noting that <m>28</m> is the LCD of the fractions in the first equation and <m>18</m> is the LCD of the fractions in the second equation.

                    Since <m>x</m> is already isolated in the first equation, let's go ahead and substitute <m>\frac{2}{5}y-2</m> for <m>x</m> in the second equation.

                    Before going any further, we can clear away the fraction by multiplying both sides of the equation by <m>5</m>.

                    Now that we know that the value of <m>y</m> is <m>10</m>, we can substitute <m>10</m> for <m>y</m> in the equation <m>x=\frac{2}{5}y-2</m> to determine the value of <m>x</m>.

                    Regardless of which variable we isolate, there are going to be fractions in the resultant equation.  We'll have one fewer fraction if we isolate <m>x</m> in the first equation, so let's do that.

                    Time to roll up our sleeves, because we're going to tackle the following system of equations.

                    Once we get over the shock of all the fractions, let's focus on eliminating them.  The LCD of the fractions in the first equation is <m>6</m> and the LCD of the fractions in the second equations is <m>15</m>, so we can clear the fractions in the first equation by multiplying both sides by <m>6</m> and we can clear the fractions from the second equation by multiplying both sides by <m>15</m>.

                    Regardless of the variable we isolate, the resultant equation will have fractions.  As far as fractions go, thirds are relatively friendly, so let's isolate <m>x</m> in the second equation.

                    Our first instinct might be to clear away all of the fractions, but that's probably not the best option.  While we definitely want to clear the fractions from the first equation, a better option for the second equation is probably to just go ahead and isolate <m>y</m>.  We begin with the second action.

        <statement>
          <p>
            Consider the following system of equations.          
            <me>
              \left\{
                \begin{aligned}
                  3x-2y\amp=-4\\
                  -4x+2y\amp=-2\\
                \end{aligned}
              \right.
            </me>
            We could solve the system by graphing or by using the method of substitution.  There are many other options, however, and we are going to exploit one of the additional options <mdash/> we are going to use the elimination method (sometimes referred to as the addition method).
          </p>
          <p>
            Let's assume that there is only one ordered pair that satisfies both equations in the system.  We we replace <m>x</m> and <m>y</m> with the coordinates of that ordered pair, the first equation becomes <m>-4=-4</m> and the second equation becomes <m>-2=-2</m>.  Note that if we add the respective sides of those equations, we arrive at another true statement, namely <m>-6=-6</m>.  This phenomenon extends to solving the system <mdash/> whatever ordered pair(s) satisfies both equations in the system will also solve the equation that results from adding the respective sides of the equations.  For the system under consideration, that is a mighty useful fact, because the action will (temporarily) eliminate <m>y</m> from the system and we can solve the resultant equations for <m>x</m>.  We can then substitute that value for <m>x</m> in either of the original equations to determine the value of <m>y</m>.  Let's see that plan in action.
          </p>
          <p>
            Consider the following system of equations.          
            <me>
              \left\{
                \begin{aligned}

                \end{aligned}
              \right.
            </me>
            We begin by adding the left sides of the equations together and equating that to the sum of the right sides of the equations.  The result is
            <me>-x=-6</me>.
            We then solve that equation for <m>x</m>.

            The solution to the given system of equations is the ordered pair <m>(6,11)</m>.
          </p>
          <p>
            Now let's consider the following system of equations.          
            <me>
              \left\{
                \begin{aligned}
                  2x+3y\amp=23\\
                  6x-5y\amp=-1\\
                \end{aligned}
              \right.
            </me>
            As given, equating the sums of the respective sides of the two equations will not eliminate either <m>x</m> or <m>y</m>.  However we could multiply both sides of one of the equations by the same value so that when the sides of the new equation are added to the sides of the other equation one of the variables is eliminated.  For example, if we multiply both sides of the first equation by <m>-3</m>, the resultant coefficient on <m>x</m> will be <m>-6</m>, and when the respective sides of that equation and the original second equation are added, <m>x</m> will be eliminated.  Let's go ahead and do that.        
            <me>
              \left\{
                \begin{aligned}

                  6x-5y\amp=-1\\

              \right.

                  -6x-9y\amp=-69\\
                  6x-5y\amp=-1\\
                \end{aligned}
              \right.
            </me>
            Equating the sums of the respective sides of the equation results in the following equation.
            <me>-14y=-70</me>
            Solving for <m>y</m> we have the following.
            <md>
              <mrow>-14y\amp=-70</mrow>

              <mrow>y\amp=5</mrow>
            </md>
            Let's go ahead and substitute <m>5</m> for <m>y</m> in the second original equation and solve the result for <m>x</m>.
            <md>
              <mrow>6x-5\highlight{y}\amp=-1</mrow>
              <mrow>6x-5(\highlight{5})\amp=-1</mrow>

              <mrow>x\amp=4</mrow>
            </md>
            So our apparent solution is <m>(4,5)</m>.  Let's go ahead and check in the given system of equations.

              \left\{

            The solution to the given system of equations is the ordered pair <m>(4,5)</m>. 
          </p>
          <p>
            Assuming that a system of two equations with two unknowns has exactly one ordered pair in its solution set, the process for determining that solution is outlined below.  The outline is followed by a note specifying how you recognize that there are no solutions or an "infinite number" of solutions while going through the elimination process. 
            <ol label="1">
              <li>
                Before proceeding to the next step, both equations should be written in standard form (<m>ax+by=c</m>).  Rearrange the terms as necessary so that this is the case.
              </li>
              <li>
                If there are like terms in the two equations with opposite coefficients (same absolute value, opposite signs), go ahead and add the respective sides of the two equations so that the variable associated with those terms is eliminated.  If no such terms exist, multiply both sides of one equation by a number, and perhaps both sides of the other equation by a different number, so that one of the variables does have opposite coefficients in the two equations.  Then add the two respective sides of the new system so that the variable with opposite coefficients is eliminated.
              </li>

                Solve the equation that emerges from step 2 for the remaining variable.

              <li>
                Substitute the value determined in step 3 into either of the original equations and solve for the remaining variable.

              <li>
                Check your proposed solution in both of the original equations.  Assuming it is correct, state your conclusion.  If the solution is not correct, find your mistake and/or rework the problem from scratch.

            Systems that either have no solutions or an "infinite number of solutions" reveal their nature when you execute step 2 of the process.  In either case, both variables sum to zero while performing the step.  If the system has no solutions, you are left with a contradiction (a false statement such as <m>0=2</m>).  If the system has an "infinite number" of solutions, you are left with an identity (a true statement such as <m>5=5</m>).

          <p>Solution</p>
          <p>
            Neither variable has opposite coefficients in the two equations, and there is no way of establishing opposite coefficients that doesn't lead to fractions if we only multiply both sides of only one of the equations by a constant.  Because the coefficients on <m>x</m> already have opposite signs, I'm choosing to eliminate <m>x</m> by multiplying both sides of the first equation by <m>5</m> and both sides of the second equation by <m>4</m>.  Note that I could have chosen to eliminate <m>y</m> by, say, multiplying both sides of the first equation by <m>-3</m> and both sides of the second equation by <m>5</m>.

        <statement>
          <p>
            When presented with an application problem with two unknowns, it can be helpful to arrange the information in a table from which we can infer two equations.  Let's see a couple of examples. 
          </p>
          <p>Example</p>
          <p>
            Mohamed has his retirement money invested in two accounts, one "safe" and the other highly speculative.  At the beginning of 2017 the two accounts combined had a total of $27,872.00.  Over the course of the year the safe account earned 2.5% interest while the speculative account grew by 43%.  Mohamed made no deposits to nor withdrawals from either account over the course of the year.  At the end of the year the total balance between the two accounts was $35,944.26.  How much did Mohamed have invested in each account at the beginning of 2017?  Assume that the start of the year the amount in each account was a whole dollar amount.
          </p>
          <p>Solution</p>
          <p>
            Let's begin by defining <m>x</m> to be the amount ($) that Mohamed had invested in the safe account at the beginning of 2017 and <m>y</m> the amount he had invested in the speculative account at the beginning of 2017.  Let's also note that the total growth in the balance of the two accounts over the course of 2017 was $8,072.26 (the difference between $34,966.26 and $27,872.00).  The information we know about the accounts is summarized in <xref ref="workshop-systems-table-Mohamed-examples">Table</xref>.

            In each row of the table, the amounts in the safe and speculative accounts sum to to the total amount.  That leads to the following sustem of equations.
            <me>

            We can eliminate <m>x</m> from the system by multiplying both sides of the first equation by <m>-.025</m> and then summing the respective sides of the two equations in the resultant system.

            Let's equate the sums of the respective sides of the equations and solve the resultant equation for <m>y</m>.

            Substituting <m>18,211</m> for <m>y</m> in the equation <m>x+y=27,872</m> will enable us to determine the value for <m>x</m>.

          <p>Example</p>
          <p>
            Jim and Jim are lab partners in chemistry class.  The two Jim's are tasked with the creation of 3 liters of a solution that is 35.2% acid and 64.8% water.  They have two solutions to work with.  One of the existing solutions is 40% acid (and 60% water) while the other is 28% acid (and 72% water).  How much of each solution should the Jim's use in their mixture?
          </p>
          <p>Solution (pun unavoidable)</p>
          <p>
            Let's define <m>x</m> to be the amount (liters) of 40% acid solution that should be used and <m>y</m> be the amount (liters) of 28% acid solution that should be used.  Let's note that the amount of acid in the final solution is 35.3% of 3 liters which is 1.056 liters.

                        In both the investment and interest rows, the individual amounts from the two accounts must sum to the total.  This gives us the following system of equations.

                        We can solve the problem two different ways - by focusing on her goal that 50% of the beans are red or by focusing on her goal that 50% of the beans are green.  Below I focus on the goal of 50% red beans.  You should also work the problem focusing on the goal that 50% of the beans are green and see that you get the same result.

                        From the first equation we have <m>y=12-x</m> which we use to make a substitution in the second equation.

                At the start of the year Nguyen had $15,000 invested in two separate IRA accounts - one a traditional IRA, the other a Roth IRA.  Over the course of the year, the traditional IRA balance grew by 21% and the the Roth IRA balance grew by 17%.  Nguyen made no deposits to nor withdraws from either account over the course of the year.  At the end of the year the total balance of the two accounts was $17,718.  How much did Nguyen have invested in each account at the beginning of the year?

        <statement>
          <p>
            In the equation <m>D=rt</m>,  <m>D</m> represents distance,  <m>r</m> represents rate (speed), and  <m>t</m> represents time.  For example, if you drive at a constant speed of 65 mph for 2 hours, then the total distance covered over those hours is determined as follows.
            <md>
              <mrow>D\amp=rt</mrow>
              <mrow>\amp=(65\,\frac{\text{miles}}{\text{hr}})(2\,\text{hr})</mrow>
              <mrow>\amp=110\,\text{miles}</mrow>
            </md>
            Similarly, the amount of time it takes to drive 175 miles at a constant rate of 70 mph is calculated below.
            <md>
              <mrow>t\amp=\frac{D}{r}</mrow>
              <mrow>\amp=\frac{175\,\text{miles}}{70\frac{\text{miles}}{\text{hr}}}</mrow>
              <mrow>\amp=2.5\,\text{hr}</mrow>
            </md>
             The equation <m>D=rt</m> and its variations (e.g. <m>t=\frac{D}{r}</m>) frequently come into play when solving applications involving moving objects.  Let's see a couple of examples.
          </p>
          <p>Example</p>
          <p>
            Chao and Elyse are in separate cars both driving on I-65.  At noon one day Elyse (driving north) passes Chao (driving south).  For the next 15 minutes each car maintains the exact speed they were traveling at noon.  By 12:15 pm that day the distance (along the highway) between the two cars was 33.75 miles.  During those 15 minutes Elyse's constant speed was 9 mph faster than Chao's constant speed.  Determine the constant speeds that  were maintained by the two drivers over those 15 minutes.
          </p>
          <p>Solution</p>
          <p>
            Let <m>x</m> represent the constant speed (mph) maintained by Elyse and <m>y</m> represent the constant speed (mph) maintained by Chao.  Some of the information relevant to solution is shown in <xref ref="workshop-systems-Elyse-and-Chao-examples">Table</xref>.  In each row of the table, the expression found in the Distance column was determined using <m>D=rt</m>.

            The fact that Elyse's constant speed was 9 mph greater than Chao gives us <me>x=y+9</me>.  The fact that that the distance betweens the two cars was 33.75 miles after 15 minutes gives us <me>.25x+.25y=33.75</me>.  Let's substitute <m>y+9</m> for <m>x</m> in the second equation and then solve for <m>y</m>.

            So Chao maintained a constant speed of 62 mph and seeing as Elyse maintained a constant speed that was 9 mph greater than Chao's, her constant speed was 71 mph.  Let's make sure that our conclusion makes sense.
          </p>
          <p>
            The distance traveled in 15 minutes at a speed of 62 mph is: <me>(62\,\frac{\text{miles}}{\text{hr}})(.25\,\text{hr})=15.5\,\text{miles}</me>.  The distance traveled in 15 minutes at a speed of 71 mph is: <me>(71\,\frac{\text{miles}}{\text{hr}})(.25\,\text{hr})=17.75\,\text{miles}</me>.<me>15.5\,\text{miles}+17.75\,\text{miles}=33.25\,\text{miles}\,\checkmark</me>

          <p>Example</p>
          <p>
            When moving along a river, a boat's speed relative to the land is determined by both the speed at which it would be moving in still water and the speed of the current.  While moving downstream (with the current), the two speeds are added.  While moving upstream (against the current), the speed of the current is subtracted from the speed the boat would maintain in still water.
          </p>
          <p>
            One afternoon Cisco took his fishing boat out on the Willamette.  He set the boat's motor to a constant (still water) cruising speed and motored 20 miles upstream before turning around and motoring the same 20 miles back downstream.  The trip upstream took 2 hours to complete while the trip back downstream took only 50 minutes.  Assuming that both the (still water) cruising speed and the speed of the current were constant the entire trip, determine both of those speeds.
          </p>
          <p>Solution</p>
          <p>
            Define <m>x</m> to be the (still water) cruising speed (mph) of the boat and <m>y</m> to be the speed of the current.  The information from the problem is summarized in <xref ref="workshop-systems-Cisco-examples">Table</xref>.

            Before stating a conclusion, let's make sure that our answers make sense.  When going upstream, the speed of the boat relative to the land is the difference of the two speeds, i.e. 10 mph.
            <me>(10\,\frac{\text{miles}}{\text{hr}})(2\,\text{hr})=20 \,\text{miles}\,\checkmark</me>
            When going downstream, the speed of the boat relative to the land is the sum of the two speeds, i.e. 24 mph.
            <me>(24\,\frac{\text{miles}}{\text{hr}})(\frac{5}{6}\,\text{hr})=20 \,\text{miles}\,\checkmark</me>
            So the (still water) cruising speed of the boat was 17 mph and the speed of the current was 7 mph.

              <li>
                Two cars are moving toward each other on a straight and flat east-west highway through th Great Plains of Canada.  Because the highway is so straight and flat, with the cruise controls engaged each car is able to maintain constant speed for two hours  At the start of the two hours the cars are 324 km apart and they cross past each other at the end of the two hours.  During the two hours period the constant speed of the westbound car is 18 km/hr greater than the constant speed of the eastbound car.  Determine the constant speed of each of the cars.
              </li>

              <li>
                The jet-stream produces a steady wind that blows high in the atmosphere from the west to the east.  The wind is powerful enough that it increases the speed of an eastbound flight and decreases the speed of a westbound flight.  For example, if the jet-stream wind is 80 mi/hr and a plane's speed relative to the ground would be 400 mi/hr in still air, then its seed relative to the ground when flying east is 480 mi/hr while its speed when flying west is 320 mi/hr.

                Hoda works as a pilot for Richfolks Air.  She flies a root between Seattle and Denver.  During the flight she usually maintains maximum airspeed (the speed the plane would fly in perfectly still air) for 1200 miles of the flight.  One particular Tuesday the wind produced by the jet-stream was constant the entire day.  On that day the mentioned 1200 mile stretch from Seattle to Denver (eastbound) took 2 hours to complete while the same 1200 mile stretch from Denver to Seattle (westbound) took 2 hours and 40 minutes to complete.  Determine the airspeed and wind speed on that day.

                  Let <m>x</m> represent the constant speed (km/hr) of the westbound car and <m>y</m> represent the constant speed (km/hr) of the eastbound car.  Since both cars travel for two hours, the distances traveled over the two hours are <m>2x</m> and <m>2y</m>.  Between the two cars, a total of 324 km are traversed over those two hours, which gives us the first equation in the system that models the problem.
                  <me>2x+2y=324</me>
                  We are told that the westbound car moves at a rate that is 18 km/hr greater than the rate at which the eastbound car moves.  This gives us the second equation in the system. <me>x=y+18</me>.
                  We begin solving the system by substituting <m>y+18</m> for <m>x</m> in the distance equation.

                  So the slower car (eastbound) travels at the rate of <m>72</m> km/hr and the faster car (westbound) travels at <m>90</m> km/hr.  In two hours the cars travel, respectively, <m>144</m> km and <m>180</m> km, and sure enough, <m>144+188=324</m> <m>\checkmark</m>.

              <li>
                While on route, there are two speeds associated with a jet.  One is the airspeed - the speed the jet would fly relative to the ground if there were no wind.  The other is is the ground speed - the speed the jet actually moves relative to the ground.  The wind due to the jet stream increases the ground speed of eastbound flights and decreases the ground speed of west bound flights,  For example, if the airspeed is 400 mph and the wind speed is 50 mph, then the actual ground speed of an eastbound flight is 450 mph and the ground speed of a west bound flight is 350 mph.  (This is a simplification of the specific impact of the jet stream, but reflective of the general concept.)
                One afternoon two 747s are flying between San Francisco and Denver, one headed west (to San Francisco), the other headed east (to Denver).  For 2.5 hours the two planes maintained the same constant airspeed.  Over that period the eastbound flight traveled 1665 miles while the westbound flight only traveled 1185 miles.  Determine the airspeed and wind speed for those 2.5 hours.

                Olivia and her wife Jackie like to go running at the local high school track.  On average, Jackie maintains a pace that is 30% greater than the pace maintained by Olivia.  Over a thirty minute period, Jackie runs .825 miles farther than Olivia.  Determine the speed (mi/hr) of each runner, assuming that they each maintain a constant speed for the entire thirty minute period.
