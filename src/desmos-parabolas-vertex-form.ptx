    <title>Activities and Problems</title>
    
      <p>The following activities and problems are based upon equations of form <m>y=a(x-h)^2+k</m>, <m>a\neq0</m>.
      </p>

          <exercise>
            <title>An activity focused on the effect of the constants <m>h</m> and <m>k</m> in the standard parobolic equation</title>

                      In the Desmos graph, activate "Show vertex" by clicking on the circle to the left of the statement.  For each row in <xref ref="table-6-1">Table</xref>, slide the values of <m>h</m> and <m>k</m> in the Desmos graph to the values stated in the table-row and make note of the vertex.  Look for a pattern.  In the Desmos graph, change the value of <m>a</m> to anything you like (other than 
                      <m>0</m>) and repeat the exercise.  Does the altered value of <m>a</m> have any effect on the location of the vertex?

            <title>An activity focused on the axis of symmetry for the parabola</title>
            <statement>
              <p>In the Desmos graph, deactivate "Show vertex" and activate "Show axis of symmetry."  For any given parabola whose equation has the form <m>y=a(x-h)^2+k</m>, the vertical line <m>x=h</m> is called the axis of symmetry for the parabola.  One way to think about the axis of symmetry is that if you were able to fold your screen across the line, the two halves of the parabola formed by the line would lie atop one another.
              </p>
              <p>
                For each of the equations given below, state the value of <m>h</m> and in the Desmos graph slide the value of <m>h</m> accordingly.  Without changing the value of <m>h</m>, slide the values of <m>a</m> and <m>k</m> back and forth and note that whatever their values, the resultant parabola is symmetric across the line 
                <m>x=h</m>

            <title>A prepatory activity related to completion of the square: <m>y=(x-h)^2+k</m></title>
            <statement>
              <p>
                In the Desmos graph, deactivate both "Show vertex" and "Show axis of symmetry" by clicking on the circles to their lefts (if necessary).  Activate the equation below "Enter a parobolic equation ..." by clicking on the circle to the left of the equation.  Slide the value of <m>a</m> to <m>1</m> and leave it there for this enire activity.
              </p>
              <p>
                The standard form equation stated in the Desmos graph is intially <m>y=x^2-6x+4</m>.  Note that the vertx of the resultant parabola is located at the point <m>(3,-5)</m>.  This means that in the vertex form of the equation, <m>h=3</m> and <m>k=-5</m>; use the sliders in the Desmos graph to verify this.
              </p>
              <p>
                Because the graphs of <m>y=x^2-6x+4</m> and <m>y=(x-3)^2-5</m> are identical, it must be the case that <m>x^2-6x+4=(x-3)^2-5</m> for all values of <m>x</m>.  The process of manipulating the standard form expression into the vertex form of the expression is called "completing the square."  The value of <m>h</m> in the vertex form equivalent of the equation <m>y=x^2+bx+c</m> is always <m>-\frac{b}{2}</m>
              </p>
              <p>
                For each equation of form <m>y=x^2+bx+c</m> given in <xref ref="table-6-2">Table</xref>:
              </p>
              <ol label="1">
                <li>Enter the standard form equation into the Desmos graph and make note of the vertex.</li>
                <li>State the values of <m>b</m> and <m>h</m> and confirm that <m>h=-\frac{b}{2}</m>.</li>
                <li>Use the Desmos activity to verify that <m>y=(x-h)^2+k</m> indeed graphs to the same parabola as did the standard form of the equation.</li>
                <li>By hand, expand and simplify the right side of the vertex form of the equation and confirm that it does in fact simplify to the right side of the standard form equation.</li>

            <title>Completing the square on equations of form <m>y=x^2+bx+c</m></title>
            <statement>
              <p>
                The process of completing the square involves adding a numeric term to an expression of form <m>x^2+bx</m> so that the resultant trinomial factors into a perfect square.  The number that completes the square is always <m>(\frac{b}{2})^2</m> and the resultant factorization is always <m>(x+\frac{b}{2})^2</m>.
              </p>
              <p>
                 To complete the square on an equation of form <m>y=x^2+bx+c</m>, perform the following steps.
              </p>

                  <li>Inside the parantheses, add <m>(\frac{b}{2})^2</m> and balance that addition by subtracting <m>(\frac{b}{2})^2</m> outside the parantheses: <me>y=(x^2+bx+(\frac{b}{2})^2)+c-(\frac{b}{2})^2</me></li>
                  <li>Factor the trinomial expression in the parantheses and combine the numeric terms outside the parantheses: <me>y=(x+\frac{b}{2})^2+(c+(\frac{b}{2})^2)</me></li>

            <statement>
              <p>
                Having a coefficient on the squared term that does not equal <m>1</m> adds quite a bit of complexity to the completing the square process.  Rather than stating the steps using letters, let's illustrate them with specific parabolic equations.

                  Use the completing the square process to determine the vertex form of the equation of the parabola whose standard form equation is <m>y=2x^2+12x+7</m>.

                  <li>
                    Complete the square inside the parantheses and balance the addition outside the parantheses.  Since every term inside the parantheses is multiplied by <m>a</m>, you must multiply what you add inside the parantheses by <m>a</m> to determine the number that is subtracted outside the parantheses.
                    <me>y=2(x^2+6x+9)+7-18</me>
                    To reiterate, because we multiplied the additional 9 by 2, we need to subtract by 18 to compensate for the addition.

                    That was a little tricky - at first glance it looks like we added <m>4</m> twice - not good.  But there's a negative sign in front of those parantheses, so while we did indeed add <m>4</m> inside the parantheses, from the big picture perspective we actually subtracted by <m>4</m> which needed to be balanced by adding <m>4</m> outside the parantheses.
