                    Suppose that the run along the slope triangle was <m>2</m>.
                    What would the rise then be? Use the sliders labeled

                   Use the slider labeled <m>m</m> to set the slope to <m>-4</m>.

                   (Recall that the run is defined as <m>x_2-x_1</m>, so if the run is negative,
                   the point labeled <m>(x_1,y_1)</m> must be to the right of the point
                   labeled <m>(x_2,y_2)</m>.) Is the run what you expected it to be? <var name="8" width="10" />

            <title>Open-Ended Question</title>
              <statement>
                <p>
                  Adjust the sliders so that <m>m=\frac{1}{2}</m>, <m>x_1=-2</m>, and <m>x_2=3</m>.
                  Click the arrow to the left of the slider labeled <m>b</m>.  Watch the slope triangle
                  as the line moves up and down.  Stop the motion by clicking the pause button to the
                  left of the slider.  Other than moving up and down (along with the line), in what
                  way does the slope triangle change (kind of a trick question).  Can you think
                  of something that must be ture about two lines if and if the lines are parallel? 
                </p>
              </statement>
              <solution>
                <p>
                  Other than moving the slope triangle up and down, changing the vertical position of the line has no effect upon the slope triangle.  One implication of this is that two (non-vertical) lines are
                  parallel if and only if they have equal slope.
                </p>
              </solution>

            <title>Open-Ended Question</title>
              <statement>
                <p>
                  Adjust the slider labeled <m>b</m> so that the line crosses the <m>y</m>-axis 
                  somewhere close to the origin.  Use the slider labeled <m>m</m> to manually change the slope.
                  What is true about all lines with positive slope that is distinct from all lines with negative slope?
                  What is true about a line when its slope is zero?  Change the value of <m>b</m> and confirm your
                  conjecture about positive, negative, and zero slopes. 
                </p>
              </statement>
              <solution>
                <p>
                  All lines with positive slope increase (go upward) from left-to-right whereas all lines with negative slope decrease (go downward) from left-to-right.  All lines with a slope of zero are horizontal.  
                  Although you can't verify it with the Desmo graph, vertical lines have no slope (sometimes stated as an undefined slope).
