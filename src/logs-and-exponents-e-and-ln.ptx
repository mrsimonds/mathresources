  <title>The Number <m>e</m>; The Natural Logarithm Function</title>

  <paragraphs>
    <title>The Number <m>e</m></title>
    <p></p>
    <p>
      The number <m>e</m> is an irrational number approximately equal to 2.718. The number is also referred to as Euler's number.  It shows up in a disparate number of applications and can be computed in several different ways.
    </p>
    <p>
      Two of the foundational topics in calculus are derivatives and integrals.  Euler's number plays a pivotal role in both of those branches of mathematics.
    </p>
    <p>
      The main topic associated with derivatives is the rate at which functions change.  For example, if <m>f</m> is a function that models the value of the Dow Jones Index <m>t</m>seconds after the opening bell,  the first derivative of <m>f</m> would tell you the rate at which that value is changing at any given time during that day.  When the value of <m>f</m> is increasing, the first derivative has a positive value. When the value of <m>f</m> is decreasing the first derivative has a negative value.  The rate of change is represented graphically by the slope of the tangent line to the function at the point associated with the time in question.  The tangent line passes through the point in question and has the same slope as the function at that particular point

        Two tangent lines are illustrated in <xref ref="logs-and-exponents-e-and-ln-figure-1">Figure</xref>.  The tangent line at the point <m>(4,5)</m> has a slope of <m>-2</m>.  If this function represented the position (in ft) of the tide line of Lake Michigan (relative to some fixed point) <m>t</m> seconds before or after noon, then four seconds after noon the tide line is receding at a rate of two ft/sec.

    <p>
      One fact about the number <m>e</m> is that it is the base of the exponential function whose curve has a very unique property.  The function <m>y=e^x</m> is the only function with the property that its tangent line at any given point had a slope equal to the <m>y</m>-coordinate of the point.  In <xref ref=logs-and-exponents-e-and-ln-figure-2>Figure</xref>, the function <m>y=e^x</m> has been drawn along with the tangent lines at the point <m>(0,1</m> as well as the (approximate) point <m>(1.099,3)</m>.  Note that the lines have, respectively, slopes of 1 and 3.
