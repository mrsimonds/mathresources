        <p>
          The materials begin with linear equations in two variables and extends through trigonometry.
          </p>
          <p>

          Each topic includes written introductions, detailed examples, and practice exercises that are fully keyed. In addition, each chapter concludes with additional practice problems – those problems are not keyed, although short answers are provided. Many topics also include videos.       Each topic has its own link, so students can be referred to the pages directly.
          </p>
          <p>

          The material was written with review in mind, but there is enough detail that it would be useful for new students as well. All exercises in the content areas are fully keyed, with no steps excluded. The supplemental problem sets only include answers; they are not fully keyed. Each individual topic (e.g. factoring by grouping) has its own URL, so it is easy for instructors to send their students direct links. While video instruction is useful for many, there are also learners who prefer written exposition, hence the redundancy in presentation of material. Students engaged in self-study review can quickly become frustrated while working practice problems, hence the thorough explanations in the solutions to the practice problems. The workshop problems provide a bank for instructors or tutors to work with students in an interactive, “I do one, you do one” fashion.
          </p>
          <p>

          I envision the materials being used in various ways, particularly in online courses. “Heads up” links can be posted before pivotal topics. For example, links to the factoring materials could be posted the week before rational expressions are to be covered. Links to specific topics that have been identified as specific weaknesses in specific students can be sent directly to those students. The site can also be used to supplement the class in which a given topic is taught. For example, problem sets can be projected for group work in lieu of printed assignments. Of course, there are ways to use the materials that haven’t occurred to me.
          </p>
          <p>
          Feedback is appreciated, both from faculty and students. I’m especially eager to know of any mistakes, so that I can fix them ASAP. 
        </p>
        <p>
          A special note of appreciation to those who created and maintain Geogebra.  Geogebra 5 was used to make all of the interactive activities on this site.
