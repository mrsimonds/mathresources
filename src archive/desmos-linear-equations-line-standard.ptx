    <exercise>
        <title>A question about the intercepts of a line</title>
            <statement>
                <p>
                  Determine, by hand, the <m>x</m>-intercept and <m>y</m>-intercept of the line with equation
                  <m>2x-3y=6</m>.  Remember to state the intercepts as ordered pairs.  Check you answer by
                  using the Desmos sliders to set <m>a</m> to <m>2</m>, <m>b</m> to <m>-3</m>, and <m>c</m> 
                  to <m>6</m>.
                </p>
            </statement>
            <solution>
              <p>
                To determine the <m>x</m>-intercept (where the line crosses the <m>x</m>-axis), we replace <m>y</m>
                with <m>0</m> and solve for <m>x</m>.  Solving <m>2x-3(0)=6</m> results in <m>3</m>, so the 
                <m>x</m>-intercept is <m>(3,0)</m>.
              </p>
              <p>
                To determine the <m>y</m>-intercept (where the line crosses the <m>y</m>-axis), we replace <m>x</m>
                with <m>0</m> and solve for <m>y</m>.  Solving <m>2(0)-y=6</m> results in <m>-2</m>, so the 
                <m>y</m>-intercept is <m>(0,-2)</m>.

                  using the desmos sliders to set <m>a</m> to <m>4</m>, <m>b</m> to <m>1</m>, and <m>c</m>

            <solution>
              <p>

        <title>An activity about lines whose equations can be expressed in the form <m>y=c</m></title>
            <statement>
                <p>
                  Set the value of <m>a</m> to <m>0</m> and the value of <m>b</m> to <m>1</m>.  Note that this results in equations of form <m>y=c</m>.  Slide the value of <m>c</m> back and forth.  What do all lines whose equations can be expressed in the form <m>y=c</m> have in common?
                </p>
            </statement>
            <solution>
              <p>
                Every line whose equation can be expressed in the form <m>y=c</m> is horizontal.
